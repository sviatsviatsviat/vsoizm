    Number used as logic:                   22,115 out of  53,200   41%
      Number using O6 output only:          20,213
      Number using O5 output only:               0
      Number using O5 and O6:                1,902
      Number used as ROM:                        0

Slice Logic Distribution:
  Number of LUT Flip Flop pairs used:       22,115
    Number with an unused Flip Flop:         3,502 out of  22,115   15%
    Number with an unused LUT:                   0 out of  22,115    0%
    Number of fully used LUT-FF pairs:      18,613 out of  22,115   84%
    Number of unique control sets:               2
    Number of slice register sites lost
      to control set restrictions:               0 out of 106,400    0%

  A LUT Flip Flop pair for this architecture represents one LUT paired with
  one Flip Flop within a slice.  A control set is a unique combination of
  clock, reset, set, and enable signals for a registered element.
  The Slice Logic Distribution report is not meaningful if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-slice resource or if Placement fails.
  OVERMAPPING of BRAM resources should be ignored if the design is
  over-mapped for a non-BRAM resource or if placement fails.
